## Rendering UFAL Art Gallery using OpenGL

<nav style='font-align:justify'>The main goal of the project is to render, using OpenGL [1], an historical building of Maceio [2], capital city of Alagoas [3], state located at northeast Brazil [4]. The historical building choosed to be render in this project was the Art Gallery of UFAL [5], once used as the university rectory. The project was developed using the programming language Java [6] and the IDE Eclipse [7].

This project was made to be graded at the course of Computer Graphics [8], lectured by
<a href="https://github.com/oliveiramc" target="_blank">Professor Marcelo Costa Oliveira</a> and available at <a href='http://www.ufal.edu.br/unidadeacademica/ic/graduacao/ciencia-da-computacao' target='_blank'>Computer Science</a> and <a href='http://www.ufal.edu.br/unidadeacademica/ic/graduacao/engenharia-de-computacao' target='_blank'>Computer Engineering</a> degrees of the <a href="http://www.ic.ufal.br" target="_blank">Institute of Computing</a> at <a href="http://www.ufal.edu.br" target="_blank">UFAL - Federal University of Alagoas</a>.

We recommend you use Eclipse to open the project, to avoid compilation/execution problems, since it was the same IDE that we used and to assure your execution, but you can use any Java IDE that you prefer.

Feel free to perform a pull request to the project, implementing additional functions or improving some of the existents.<br>

<h2>OpenGL</h2>

OpenGL is the premier environment for developing portable, interactive 2D and 3D graphics applications. Since its introduction in 1992, OpenGL has become the industry's most widely used and supported 2D and 3D graphics application programming interface (API), bringing thousands of applications to a wide variety of computer platforms. OpenGL fosters innovation and speeds application development by incorporating a broad set of rendering, texture mapping, special effects, and other powerful visualization functions. Developers can leverage the power of OpenGL across all popular desktop and workstation platforms, ensuring wide application deployment.

<h2>Eclipse</h2>

Eclipse is a platform that has been designed from the ground up for building integrated web and application development tooling. By design, the platform does not provide a great deal of end user functionality by itself. The value of the platform is what it encourages: rapid development of integrated features based on a plug-in model. Eclipse provides a common user interface (UI) model for working with tools.  It is designed to run on multiple operating systems while providing robust integration with each underlying OS.  Plug-ins can program to the Eclipse portable APIs and run unchanged on any of the supported operating systems.

To install Eclipse, download the IDE clicking <a href='https://eclipse.org/downloads/' target='_blank'>here</a>

<h2>Running the project</h2>

To execute the project, create a folder, pull the repository inside and import the created folder containing the reposity to your IDE, eg. eclipse.
